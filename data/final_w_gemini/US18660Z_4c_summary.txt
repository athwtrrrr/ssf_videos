    Rising global temperatures, driven by pollutants like carbon dioxide and nitrogen oxide from forest fires, factories, and vehicles, create an urban heat island effect where cities are significantly warmer than rural areas. Moss architecture, a green design trend that uses living moss on building walls and rooftops, is presented as a solution to combat this issue. A common species used is *Hypnum* moss, which has been tested in experimental wall systems across traffic, town, and industrial zones. These living walls function by absorbing carbon dioxide and releasing oxygen through photosynthesis, while their dense leaves trap dust, smoke, and other pollutants from the air. Moss also mitigates urban heat by absorbing sunlight, unlike heat-trapping concrete, and cools the surrounding air by releasing moisture through evapotranspiration. Furthermore, its soft, sponge-like texture helps reduce noise pollution by absorbing sound waves. A major advantage of moss is that it does not require soil, needing only water and shade to thrive, which makes it particularly suitable for humid climates like Malaysia's. Real-world examples include residential buildings with living moss roofs for natural cooling and Singapore's Changi Airport, which uses moss indoors to freshen the air and reduce noise. Another notable example is Japan's Kokedera Moss Temple, which is covered in 120 types of moss, creating a serene, natural environment. The video envisions cities like Kuala Lumpur transformed by moss architecture into cooler, greener urban spaces with cleaner air. It concludes that while human activity heats up cities, small natural elements like moss can create a significant positive change for a more sustainable future. This highlights the underestimated power of nature in solving modern environmental problems.
