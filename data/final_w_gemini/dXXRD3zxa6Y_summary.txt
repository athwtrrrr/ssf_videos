    A panel of four women in STEM from corporate management, structural engineering, and academia shared their diverse and often non-linear career paths. They emphasized the value of complementing technical degrees with further education, such as an MBA or project management diploma, to develop crucial business and leadership skills. The speakers identified creative problem-solving and continuous learning as the most rewarding aspects of their jobs, while also noting challenges like managing remote teams, navigating steep learning curves, and the ambiguity inherent in developing new solutions. To successfully transition from university to the workplace, they advised students to supplement formal education with practical experience gained through volunteering, networking, and university activities. Building a strong CV and proactively seeking out mentors on platforms like LinkedIn are essential steps for aspiring professionals.

The panelists stressed that graduates must be continuous learners, understand their own strengths, and find a healthy work-life balance to thrive. They argued that STEM is critical for future careers and that a diverse workforce is essential for creating better products and services that reflect all of society. This diversity ultimately leads to more innovative and profitable companies. The speakers offered specific advice for women, highlighting the importance of emotional intelligence, self-belief, and acting as allies to support and amplify other women's voices. They also underscored the need for work-life integration and mental well-being, sharing personal strategies for managing stress, setting boundaries, and avoiding burnout. To stay relevant in a rapidly changing world, they encouraged learning from other disciplines.

The webinar concluded by thanking the panelists for sharing their experiences and inspiring young women to pursue their passions. A representative from the Women in STEM club explained the event's importance, stating that representation from successful women is crucial to combat the high dropout rate of female students in university STEM courses. The hosts wrapped up with logistical announcements, including a thank you to participants, a survey request, and the announcement of a prize winner. The overarching goal of the event was to encourage young women by providing visible role models and practical guidance for a successful career in STEM.
