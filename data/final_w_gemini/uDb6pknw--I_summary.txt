    The "Start Talking Live showcase 2022" is a science communication competition where student finalists from Australia and Malaysia present four-minute videos on STEM topics. The event began with an interactive poll confirming the audience's belief in the importance of STEM communication, followed by the showcase of nine finalist videos, each accompanied by a Q&A with the judges. Presentations covered a range of environmental topics, including the use of green infrastructure in urban areas, modern composting to improve soil health, and the application of traditional Aboriginal cultural burning for fire management.

One presentation addressed the social issue of women's underrepresentation in STEM leadership, highlighting the gender pay gap and proposing solutions.
