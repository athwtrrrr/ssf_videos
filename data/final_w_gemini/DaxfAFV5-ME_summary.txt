    While some germs like gut bacteria and yeast are beneficial, a particularly helpful bacteria was discovered by Japanese scientists in 2016. Found at a recycling plant, this bacteria was observed consuming polyethylene terephthalate (PET) plastic, a common material used in packaging and identified by the number 1 recycling symbol. The bacteria breaks the plastic down into two environmentally harmless chemicals: terephthalic acid and ethylene glycol. These byproducts can be collected and recycled, with ethylene glycol being a valuable ingredient in antifreeze. At its observed rate, the bacteria could fully decompose a standard plastic bottle in just under one and a half years. This is a significant improvement compared to the natural degradation of PET plastic, which takes hundreds of years due to its tight, compact structure. Unlike the bacteria's clean breakdown, natural degradation merely creates smaller plastic fragments that harm wildlife and enter the human food chain. The 1.5-year decomposition period is therefore a major advancement, offering an eco-friendly result. The scale of the plastic problem is vast, with Australia alone sending nearly 440,000 tons of PET plastic to landfill between 2018 and 2019. While this discovery is still far from being a large-scale solution, it represents a powerful step in the right direction for managing plastic waste.
