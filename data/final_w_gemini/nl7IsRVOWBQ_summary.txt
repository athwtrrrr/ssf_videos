    Paleontologist Patricia Vickers-Rich attributes her career to a lifelong curiosity sparked by her upbringing on a Californian farm and her part-indigenous heritage. Her parents and teachers nurtured this curiosity by treating her as a colleague, a principle she now applies to science communication. As a teenager, she demonstrated this proactive approach by contacting the inventor of radiocarbon dating, Willard F. Libby, and building her own dating machine. Her university education at UC Berkeley and Columbia coincided with the plate tectonics revolution, giving her direct experience with major shifts in scientific understanding. A pivotal opportunity to study modern biology in Costa Rica taught her the importance of co-evolution and of seizing unconventional chances.

Her PhD research on Australian fossil birds brought her to the country, where her work revealed that central Australia was a lush environment 20 million years ago. With her husband, Tom Rich, she conducted groundbreaking research at Dinosaur Cove in Victoria, uncovering the world's greatest biodiversity of polar dinosaurs, including a species named *Leaellynasaura* after their daughter. To share these discoveries, Vickers-Rich utilizes various communication methods, such as creating museum exhibitions with detailed artistic reconstructions to engage the public. She has organized major international traveling exhibitions with colleagues in China and Russia, which fostered scientific exchange and raised crucial research funds.

Vickers-Rich founded the Monash Science Centre to serve as a hub for researcher-led public engagement, developing educational materials and outreach programs. Her communication philosophy centers on understanding the audience—from children to politicians—and tailoring the message to their background. She emphasizes the necessity of working with local colleagues when conducting research in other countries to ensure mutual benefit. Vickers-Rich concludes that intellectual curiosity should be subsidized for life, as knowledge is the foundation of public happiness. Her motivation has always been to contribute to the community and fund science education rather than seek personal financial gain. She advises aspiring communicators to be proactive, seek opportunities, and build respectful, collaborative relationships.
