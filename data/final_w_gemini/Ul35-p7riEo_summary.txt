    Professor Alan Duffy argues that science communication is essential for addressing major societal challenges like climate change and AI by creating a scientifically literate public capable of influencing leaders to make evidence-based decisions. He cites the successful public health campaigns against the tobacco industry as proof that this approach can create significant change. Effective communication hinges on storytelling to make complex ideas memorable and connect with diverse audiences on an emotional level. Presenters must tailor their message, structure, and delivery to the specific interests and background of their audience, whether they are scientists, politicians, or the general public.

Key techniques include avoiding jargon, using relatable analogies, and maintaining a positive, story-driven narrative. When communicating complex topics like climate change, simple strategies such as powerful visuals like the "climate stripes" and providing small, tangible action items are more effective than overwhelming data. It is also crucial to understand an audience's political and ideological beliefs to frame the message around shared values, fostering a sense of agency and hope. This optimistic approach is exemplified by the simple message: "It's warming. It's us. We're sure. It's bad. We can fix it."

For engaging younger audiences, authenticity and personal experience are paramount, making a presentation far more impactful than a scripted delivery. The discussion also highlights the necessity of interdisciplinary collaboration, as complex issues require combining scientific knowledge with skills from media, business, and education. A core strategy is to meet people where they are by linking scientific concepts to their personal interests.

Finally, the video introduces "citizen science" as a powerful method for building scientific literacy through partnerships between experts, industry, and the community. A detailed example showcases a co-designed robotics project with an indigenous primary school, where students became "bushfire safety engineers" to solve a relevant local problem. By anchoring the task in an authentic context, students used storytelling and technology to develop meaningful solutions. This empathetic, co-design approach is presented as a key to empowering young people and communities to engage with STEM and drive change.
