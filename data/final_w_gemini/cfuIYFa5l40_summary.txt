    A workshop on professional networking featured a diverse panel of experts from journalism, academia, consulting, entrepreneurship, government, and career counseling. The panelists shared that their career paths were driven by passion, self-awareness, and a desire to solve interesting problems. Enjoyable aspects of their roles include continuous learning, achieving tangible impacts for clients, and engaging in innovative research, while challenges involve navigating difficult workplace relationships or lacking hands-on implementation. Communication was identified as a critical skill across all fields, encompassing persuasive writing, active listening, and the ability to distill complex information for different audiences. Other essential skills mentioned were determination to overcome obstacles and adaptability to new technologies and professional landscapes.

For graduates seeking opportunities, the panel advised proactive networking through professional associations, online platforms like LinkedIn, and attending industry events. They recommended identifying and targeting a handful of desired organizations rather than relying solely on job boards. For aspiring entrepreneurs, the best time to start a business is early in one's career when financial commitments are low, focusing on solving a genuine customer need. In the IT sector, strong fundamental programming skills are crucial as they are transferable to new languages and technologies. The panelists also emphasized the importance of building an online presence and sharing information to create a reciprocal networking environment. Final advice encouraged students to overcome the fear of rejection, pursue every opportunity, and proactively connect with potential employers in an increasingly global job market.
