    The Malayan tiger, Malaysia's national animal, is a critically endangered subspecies found only in Peninsular Malaysia and southern Thailand. Culturally significant and known as "Harimau" or "Pak Belang" (Uncle Stripes), it symbolizes strength in Malay folklore. The tiger population has experienced a drastic decline, plummeting from an estimated 3,000 in the 1950s to fewer than 200 today. This sharp decrease is primarily caused by poaching for body parts sold in illegal wildlife markets and extensive habitat loss from deforestation. Conservation efforts are further hampered by inconsistent law enforcement and a lack of public awareness regarding the severity of the situation. To combat this crisis, the speakers propose the establishment of a dedicated sperm bank for Malayan tigers in Malaysia. A sperm bank collects and cryopreserves sperm for future use, which is crucial for preserving genetic diversity and supporting reproduction as the wild population shrinks. This initiative would serve as a vital tool in the long-term conservation of the species. While government action is essential, the speakers emphasize that public support is critical to making this project a reality. The video concludes with a call to action, urging viewers to sign a petition to advocate for the creation of Malaysia's first Malayan tiger sperm bank.
