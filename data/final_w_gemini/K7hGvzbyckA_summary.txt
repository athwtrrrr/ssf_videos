    A science instructor named Beta addressed the issue of equitable assessment for a large cohort with varied internet access, which made synchronous oral presentations impractical. As a solution, she redesigned the assessment, requiring students to create a layered digital artifact using an Adobe program. This new format involved a scrolling interface that integrated text, images, and embedded videos. The oral component was delivered through these embedded videos of students speaking to the camera. Students communicated the rest of their content through written text and visual elements, such as graphs, within the same interface. The project emphasized the relationship and interplay between these different communication forms. A key benefit of this design is its versatility, as the final product is a standalone piece of work. This artifact can also function as a presentation tool in a live, post-COVID context, effectively replacing traditional PowerPoint slides. To accommodate this new format, the assessment rubrics were altered. Elements of a live oral presentation that could not be captured were replaced with new criteria. These new criteria evaluated students' digital literacies and their effective use of various communication formats. This science course example illustrates how an assessment was reimagined to support students and ensure equitable access.
