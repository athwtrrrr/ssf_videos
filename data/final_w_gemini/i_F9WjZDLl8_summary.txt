    For generations, agriculture depended on traditional methods like selective breeding, but the development of genetic modification (GM) in 1973 introduced a revolutionary technology for enhancing organisms. This breakthrough, which involves inserting DNA into an organism's genome, sparked widespread public concern over potential health and environmental risks. Questions arose about whether GMOs could affect human genes, cause allergies, lead to plant hybridization, or increase pesticide use. These concerns exist alongside pressing global issues like climate change, pollution, and dwindling resources, which are diminishing suitable land for crops and worsening food security. As the global population is projected to grow by two billion by 2030, problems of world hunger and malnutrition are intensifying, with hunger-related issues causing nearly half of all child deaths.

A key example of GM technology's humanitarian potential is Golden Rice, introduced in the late 1990s. This rice variety was genetically engineered to contain beta-carotene, a precursor to Vitamin A, to combat deficiencies that cause immune dysfunction and blindness. Beyond this, GM crops can be designed with other beneficial traits, such as enhanced tolerance to heat and drought, superior nutritional profiles, and heightened resistance to pests. They can also have improved photosynthetic efficiency, making them crucial contributors to addressing global food security. While public worries persist, it is important to base decisions on the best available scientific evidence. The speaker concludes that GM crops offer a significant beacon of hope for improving global food security and achieving a hunger-free future.
