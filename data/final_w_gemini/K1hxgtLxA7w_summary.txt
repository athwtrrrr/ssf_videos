    Endophytes are microscopic fungal organisms that live within the tissues of plants in a mutualistic relationship. In this symbiotic arrangement, the endophyte protects the host plant from pathogens, facilitates nutrient uptake from the environment, and promotes overall growth and development. In return, the plant provides a stable environment where the endophyte can carry out its life cycle. A remarkable capability of endophytes is their ability to metabolize the same products as their host plant, including medically valuable compounds. This has made endophytic research an increasingly important topic in medicine, agriculture, and other industries that require antibacterials. Scientists can isolate these microorganisms from host plant tissue and place them in an ideal laboratory environment to stimulate the production of their metabolites. These products are then extracted and tested for beneficial properties. Such metabolites have shown potential for use as antibacterials, anti-inflammatories, antioxidants, and in some cases, anti-cancer agents. A significant application for these antibacterial products is in combating food poisoning. For example, Australia experiences an average of 5.4 million cases of food poisoning annually, with E. coli being a well-known cause. A 2014 study identified a specific compound from an endophyte isolated from the *Mallotus apelta* plant that exhibited antibacterial activity against E. coli and prevented its growth. This particular product could potentially be used as a food additive to prevent E. coli contamination, thereby reducing the occurrence of foodborne illness.
