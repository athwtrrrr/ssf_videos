    The Start Talking Live Showcase 2023 is an annual public speaking competition for Swinburne University students in Australia and Malaysia, designed to encourage them to share innovative ideas on global challenges. The event featured six finalists who each presented a four-minute video followed by a three-minute Q&A session with a panel of judges from academia and industry. Two presentations focused on seaweed as a climate solution: Elina proposed seaweed farming to combat ocean acidification by absorbing dissolved carbon dioxide, while Jean advocated for sinking kelp into the deep ocean to sequester atmospheric carbon. Leo addressed the environmental footprint of the pet food industry, presenting insect-based pet food as a sustainable, nutritious, and resource-efficient alternative to traditional meat products. Lynn tackled microplastic pollution, suggesting the use of biochar in solar-powered, buoy-like water filtration systems to trap harmful particles at their source in rivers. Rizwana focused on the growing crisis of electronic waste, proposing the use of environmentally friendly Deep Eutectic Solvents to efficiently extract and recycle valuable metals from discarded devices. Bao made a case for Genetically Modified (GM)
