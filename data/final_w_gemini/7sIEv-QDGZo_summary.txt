    Fossil fuels are a finite resource, creating a need for sustainable alternatives like renewable energy. While solar and wind energy are established, they are intermittent and difficult to store and transport, a problem hydrogen energy can solve. Hydrogen energy is generated by combining hydrogen with oxygen in a reaction that produces only water, making it environmentally friendly. However, the primary challenge with hydrogen is that it is a highly explosive gas under normal conditions, making it difficult and dangerous to store and transport in large quantities. A traditional storage method involves liquefying hydrogen using high pressure and low temperature, but this process is energy-intensive and requires expensive, specialized tanks.

A more promising solution is Liquid Organic Hydrogen Carrier (LOHC) technology. LOHC utilizes an oil-like organic compound that chemically binds with hydrogen, allowing it to be stored and transported safely as a liquid. The hydrogen can later be released for use, and the LOHC compound can be reused. This technology significantly improves safety, as hydrogen stored in LOHC is stable and not explosive under normal conditions. Furthermore, because LOHC is chemically similar to oil and diesel, it is compatible with existing liquid fuel infrastructure, avoiding the cost of building a new system. Future research is focused on making the hydrogen binding and release reactions more efficient and identifying the ideal LOHC compounds based on low cost, safety, and high storage capacity. Ultimately, LOHC technology holds the potential for hydrogen to replace fossil fuels.
