    The Design for Change 2022 showcase is a STEM prototype competition at Swinburne University aimed at developing students' technical, communication, and entrepreneurial skills. The event featured presentations from three finalist teams, evaluated by a judging panel from industry and the university. The first finalist, "AI Implant Dentistry," presented a deep learning system to automatically identify dental implant types from X-rays, addressing a common problem for dentists treating patients without medical records.
