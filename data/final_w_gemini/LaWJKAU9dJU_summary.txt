    The world produces 400 million tons of plastic annually, with projections reaching 1.1 billion tons by 2050. Currently, 85% of plastic ends up in landfills or as unregulated waste, and less than 10% of all plastic waste generated has ever been recycled. Traditional recycling is also limited, as the process degrades plastic durability by 95%. As a potential solution, scientists have developed a method for upcycling plastic into vanillin, the molecule responsible for vanilla's flavor and scent. Vanillin is in high demand, with 18,000 tons produced yearly, 85% of which is synthetic and often derived from petrochemicals. The experiment targeted polyethylene terephthalate (PET), a common plastic, using a discarded bottle found on the street. An enzyme was first used to break down the PET into terephthalic acid. This acid was then combined with a genetically engineered E. coli strain, which successfully converted it into vanillin within 24 hours. Through process adjustments, the researchers increased the conversion yield from an initial 5% to 79%. While conducted on a micro-scale, the potential for this technology is significant if fully optimized and scaled up. Further development could increase yields by thousands or millions and potentially expand the process to include other types of plastics, not just PET. This upcycling method could become a primary source for vanillin, allowing resources like petrochemicals to be used for more urgent needs such as energy production. This innovation offers a sustainable way to eliminate plastic waste while creating a valuable commercial product.
