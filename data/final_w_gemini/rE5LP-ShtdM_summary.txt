    The "Start Talking Live Showcase 2024" was a public speaking competition where nine student finalists from Swinburne University presented innovative ideas to address societal challenges. The event featured six group and three individual four-minute video presentations covering a range of topics aligned with social impact and sustainable development goals. One group, Aqua Sustain, proposed using Gravity-Driven Membrane technology to provide clean water in rural Sarawak, while another addressed marine pollution by using microalgae biofilms to biodegrade microplastics. A third group introduced the "Seabin Project" to collect floating plastic waste from waterways. Another presentation highlighted the plight of the critically endangered Malayan tiger, advocating for a sperm bank to aid conservation efforts. Other topics included bridging the digital literacy gap for rural Malaysian youth, repurposing poultry waste into collagen and calcium supplements, and implementing game-based learning for early childhood biology education. An individual entry discussed using green silver nanoparticles as a precise drug delivery system to combat drug resistance. After the presentations, the judges provided general feedback, advising future participants to use subtitles for accessibility, visualize data, maintain an engaging tone, and include a clear call to action. The honorable mention was awarded to the "Light of the Malayan Tiger" project for its effective use of humor and personal engagement. The unanimous winner of the Judges' Choice award was Sanjita Vinayagam for her presentation on using bioluminescent trees for sustainable urban lighting. Her project was praised for its innovative concept, clear explanation of genetic engineering, and compelling visuals. Sanjita also won the People's Choice award, which she generously passed to the honorable mention recipients. The showcase concluded by celebrating all participants and encouraging future involvement in the competition.
