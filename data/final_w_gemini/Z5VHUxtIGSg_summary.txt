    Burns are a significant global health issue, causing numerous injuries and fatalities, particularly in low and middle-income countries. Current wound care is costly and resource-intensive; in the UK, wound dressings constitute 15% of wound treatment resources, and frequent changes cause patients significant distress. To address these challenges, tilapia fish skin is proposed as an innovative xenograft for burn patients. This skin, an inedible byproduct of a widely cultivated fish, contains high levels of type one collagen, which is morphologically similar to human collagen and crucial for healing. Unlike traditional dressings, tilapia skin adheres well to the wound, preventing infection and eliminating the need for painful dressing changes. This innovative treatment can reduce financial costs for patients, improve their quality-adjusted life years, and shorten nursing time, thereby increasing healthcare productivity. For patients, it minimizes discomfort and can lower the high costs associated with long hospital stays. For healthcare systems, it offers an efficient use of limited nursing resources. However, the video notes that only a few studies have been conducted, and further research is essential to guarantee the safety of this biological dressing. A potential future consideration is that increased demand could lead to expanded fish farming, which carries the risk of disease outbreaks in over-cultivated fish populations. This potential issue would require management by the appropriate authorities. The presentation concludes by encouraging support for this healthcare implementation despite the unusual appearance of the fish skin band-aid.
