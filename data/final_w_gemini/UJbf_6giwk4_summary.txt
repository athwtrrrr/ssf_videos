    "Start Talking" is a competition open to all undergraduate students, offering them an opportunity to practice communicating a STEM topic of their choice. Participants can present on their own research, an innovative STEM idea they believe could change the world, or simply a science subject they are passionate about. The competition encourages students to share their enthusiasm for science, which encompasses everything from microorganisms to giant galaxies. The presentation format is a four-minute talk delivered to an audience and a panel of judges. The grand prize for the winner of the competition is $400. To enter, prospective participants must first submit a written application consisting of approximately 300 words of talking points. Those who successfully pass this initial stage will be invited to compete in the grand final. One of the judges explains that they will be evaluating the science talks based on three main criteria. These judging criteria are creativity, clarity of the message, and the presenter's ability to form a connection with the audience. The video concludes by encouraging students to apply and "start talking."
