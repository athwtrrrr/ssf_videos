    A proposed "smart shoe" aims to solve communication issues caused by frequent power outages in Yuendumu, a remote Indigenous community in Australia's Tanami Desert. The community experiences daily electricity disconnections, which, combined with poor cellular service, severely disrupts the use of communication devices. The proposed solution is a shoe that generates electricity by harnessing the kinetic energy from walking. With each step, a spring-loaded hinge transfers energy to a wheel that drives a dynamo, converting motion into electricity based on the principle of electromagnetic induction. This generated power is stored in an onboard rechargeable battery for later use. The device includes a voltage regulator with capacitors to provide a stable power output, smoothing out the electrical spikes created by each step. To address poor connectivity, a built-in cellular modem is designed to amplify network signals, effectively acting as a mobile hotspot. The shoe also incorporates health monitoring sensors to track the user's vital signs continuously. The primary design goal was to create a portable, grid-independent power source that uses clean energy, respecting the local community's environmental values. The project is currently at a prototype stage and has several acknowledged weaknesses. These limitations include a non-user-friendly design, the eventual degradation of its lithium batteries leading to e-waste, and its inability to power anything larger than small USB devices. Despite these constraints, the creator believes the concept has significant potential for growth and plans to further elaborate and improve the design. The ultimate aim is to enhance communication quality for the people of Yuendumu, both within the township and with the outside world.
