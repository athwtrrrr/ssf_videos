    Coral reefs, which are among the most biologically diverse ecosystems, are severely threatened by coral bleaching. This phenomenon is caused by heat stress and ocean acidification, primarily driven by climate change, which forces corals to expel their symbiotic algae. The consequences of bleaching are severe, disrupting food webs, reducing biodiversity, and impacting the livelihoods of millions of people. In April 2024, a fourth global mass bleaching event was confirmed, with 54% of the world's reefs experiencing bleaching-level heat stress. As a potential solution, scientists are exploring the use of coral probiotics to increase coral resistance to stress and disease. A 2019 study showed that probiotics significantly improved coral health and reduced the impact of bleaching stressors. Addressing environmental concerns, a 2024 study in the Red Sea found that introducing probiotics did not harm the reef and actually increased the system's microbial diversity. The use of probiotics offers several advantages over conventional restoration methods like coral gardening or transplantation. Probiotics provide a long-term solution by directly increasing the coral's tolerance to stress, rather than simply replacing damaged reefs. This method is also less expensive than facility-intensive techniques and is more environmentally friendly, as it utilizes microorganisms from the coral's natural microbiome. Scientists warn that without effective intervention, iconic reefs could become extinct by 2050. The video concludes with an urgent call to action to save these critical ecosystems before they disappear.
