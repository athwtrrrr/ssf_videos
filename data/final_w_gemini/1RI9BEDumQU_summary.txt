    The LIDA accelerated composting machines reduce composting time from twelve months to just one month by creating an optimal environment for microbes with regulated air, warmth, and food. These automated, wall-mounted units eliminate common issues like pests, odors (via carbon filters), and the spread of weeds or diseases, while also removing the need for manual turning and monitoring. The system provides a constant source of plant food, negates the need for purchased fertilizer, and helps lower greenhouse gas emissions. Two models are offered: the Batch LIDA and the Continuous LIDA. The Batch LIDA produces premium, mature compost through a three-level process: Active, Curing, and Harvest. In this model, users fill a bin which locks and heats up before automatically tipping its contents into the curing level. Once the curing vessel is full, it transfers the matured compost to the harvest level for immediate use or further aging. The Continuous LIDA is a simpler, more intuitive design with a smaller footprint that allows users to add waste anytime. It functions using a labyrinth system where new material applies pressure and a mixer pushes the compost through a series of cells. This design slows the material's flow, allowing immature compost to heat up properly while minimizing its mixture with the finished product. Users can harvest mature compost from the end of the process by turning an auger. Ultimately, the Batch LIDA prioritizes higher quality compost, whereas the Continuous LIDA offers a more compact and user-friendly experience.
