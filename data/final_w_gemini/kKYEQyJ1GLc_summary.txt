    The AAUT Connection workshop is designed to help early and mid-career researchers gain national recognition for teaching excellence through the Australian Awards for University Teaching (AAUT). These awards aim to improve the student experience, make outstanding teaching visible, and foster a scholarly, evidence-based approach to education. A successful application requires a compelling narrative built around a specific innovation or "citation theme," which must demonstrate a sustained positive impact on student learning over at least three years. This narrative must be supported by strong, diverse evidence that goes beyond simple student satisfaction surveys.

Applicants are encouraged to think creatively about proof of impact, using metrics, peer recognition, scholarly outputs, and strategic referee letters from industry partners. A key principle is the "chocolate bar test," a method to ensure all evidence is directly linked to the effectiveness of the specific teaching innovation rather than general teaching quality. Furthermore, all teaching practices must be firmly grounded in pedagogical theory and scholarly literature, and ideally, contribute back to the field. The speakers advocate for a long-term, strategic approach, advising academics to build an "evidence pipeline" over several years before applying.

This often involves a stepwise journey, starting with applications at the school or faculty level to refine the narrative and accumulate robust evidence before progressing to national awards. A case study from Health Sciences illustrated how bringing industry partners onto campus for authentic projects can build student professional identity and form the basis of a powerful application. Demonstrating a consistent teaching innovation across multiple different courses is also considered a strength. The main award categories include Citations, Teaching Excellence, and Programs that Enhance Learning. For work with a strong community focus, alternative awards like the "Shaping Australia Awards" may be more appropriate. To support this rigorous process, universities and initiatives like "MERCIS" and "Shaping STEM Futures" offer valuable resources, including professional development sessions and mentoring schemes.
