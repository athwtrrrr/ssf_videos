    The production of traditional pet food contributes significantly to global greenhouse gas emissions, a problem exacerbated by a growing world population. Pets consume an estimated 20% of the world's meat and fish, with dry kibble production alone using agricultural land nearly twice the size of the United Kingdom and contributing to 106 million tons of annual carbon dioxide emissions. As a sustainable alternative, insect-based pet food was introduced in Europe in 2015, offering a novel protein source. Unlike traditional livestock, insects like black soldier fly larvae, mealworms, and crickets can be raised using vertical farming, which requires significantly less land. The carbon dioxide emissions from producing mealworms can be up to 14 times less than that of chicken, pork, or beef. Furthermore, these insects consume organic waste, effectively acting as a waste treatment system while producing valuable byproducts like biofuels and fertilizers. Nutritionally, insects are a high-protein food source comparable to traditional meats such as chicken, beef, and fish. Research indicates that insect-based diets are safe, even for senior dogs, and have been shown to lower cholesterol levels. Insect proteins are also naturally hypoallergenic, making them suitable for pets with sensitive skin, and are more easily digestible than some animal proteins. Despite its promise, the widespread adoption of insect-based pet food faces obstacles. Further research is necessary to address uncertainties regarding species quality, potential unknown allergens, and the shelf life of these products. These challenges currently hinder its mainstream success in the global market. The potential of such sustainable alternatives in the pet food industry should be emphasized. Ultimately, achieving market success requires increased awareness and acceptance from pet owners. This will enable consumers to make informed, sustainable decisions for their pets.
