    The world's reliance on non-renewable energy sources like fossil fuels is a primary driver of climate change due to the emission of carbon dioxide. Malaysia, a developing tropical country, has a significant dependency on fossil fuels, which accounted for 90% of its electricity production in 2015. This reliance, exemplified by coal-fired plants like the Kapar power station, contributes to rising global temperatures, which increased by 1.02°C in 2020 according to NASA. While the country has explored renewable alternatives such as hydroelectric dams, these have caused environmental damage and have not fully eliminated coal usage. A more suitable solution for Malaysia is Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion (OTEC), which leverages the country's strategic location between oceans. OTEC technology generates electricity by using the temperature difference between warm ocean surface water and cold deep-ocean water. A fluid with a low boiling point, like ammonia, is vaporized by the warm surface water to power a turbine. The vapor is then condensed back into a liquid by cold water pumped from the depths, creating a continuous, emission-free cycle. A single trough off the Sabahan coast has the potential to produce 50,000 megawatts, double Malaysia's current total electricity capacity. Given that one megawatt can power roughly 650 homes, this capacity could easily supply the entire country. Adopting OTEC would allow Malaysia to transition to a sustainable energy source, slow climate change, and ensure long-term energy security. This shift would improve citizens' lives by providing reliable power without depleting finite resources. Ultimately, replacing fossil fuels with OTEC could lead the country into a new era of renewable energy and a more stable climate.
