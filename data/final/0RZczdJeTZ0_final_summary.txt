============================================================

Teresa and Miranda will talk about embedding first nation knowledge into sustainable community design. They will share tips and tricks on how to show respect and break down some of those barriers when you're speaking with First Nations peoples or you're out on country. Tina says it's not too late to make a change. We need to shift from consultation top down telling us what is going to happen to collaboration that bottom up where we're involved. We're going to go through about 11 slides and each of them are going to be topics that will grow on each other.
