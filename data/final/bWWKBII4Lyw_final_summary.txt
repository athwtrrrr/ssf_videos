Swimburn is holding a pitch competition for women in tech. We're going to show you how to make your pitch to judges. Here are some slides to help you with the structure of your pitch. The first slide should describe your product or service and how customers will be using it. Think about how you plan to keep this running across 5 to 10 years. The business model slide should talk to how are you driving revenue.
