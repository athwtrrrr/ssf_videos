The National Teaching Awards is one of the most prestigious teaching awards in the world. To apply for an award, teachers need to show that their work has had a positive impact on students' learning experience and their peers' lives. The AA connection workshop is a meeting of early career researchers and mid-career researchers from across Australia. It is also a chance for students to learn how to apply for grants and get a job in the industry. This is the first of a two-part series on teaching awards.
