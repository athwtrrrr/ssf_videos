Munda: "I feel like it's this two-way relationship with country and with the environment that people have and I'm going to talk about that in the next slide" "I think one of the best ways to sort of is to empower people. Like if your family is farmer mob, like they love farming and cultivating crops. Like there is so much power to using indigenous knowledge to help ensure that their practices are actually designed for the land" "We've got one planet. We've only got one approach. How do you approach the environment? We've got to use those skills".

Tina says it's not too late to make a change. She says we need to shift from consultation top down telling us what is going to happen to collaboration that bottom up where we're involved.

Theresa says it is not your job to be offended by what any auntie or uncle says. She says it's a job to listen and not defend what they say colonization has done to their family or their culture or their community.

Colonization in Australia wasn't just about land theft. It was about redesigning the landscape to reflect European values. Today, we have a chance to reimagine the built environment, not as something imposed, but as something as co-created with indigenous communities.

Mood: "I think as scientists sometimes we do come in and we think we know best. And that's never the case. We never do" "I am running a competition where students coming with a 4minut storytelling with the impact. What would be better than those storytelling that can come and merge with the science" "There is this separation between indigenous people and non-indigenous people" "You can read as much as you want. And this is where it's nice talking with Mood".

Too often engagement with First Nations communities is tokenistic. It's consultation after decisions have already been made. So when you're going into projects with a legacy of distrust and wasted time, you do actually have to put in the groundwork and build up that respect. Find your big three. Who are the traditional custodians of the place you feel most connected to. Mind, this is your area of expertise. Don't let your fear of saying the wrong thing deter you from ever saying anything.

Sustainable communities are not the same as everyone being the same or cultures the same. Each one of those communities you see on the IATS map is unique and is different to itself. When you start to see nature and the environment as a commodity as something that we can take that we're above and that is more that is a resource for us we start to have a problem. We can take as much water as we need because we need that more.

Teresa says the education system fails all of us in that respect, not just First Nations children. The pandemic totally affected these communities and it was interesting, she says. Miranda: "I think this was just the beginning of our connection with Teresa and Miranda".

Sustainability is not a neutral concept, but one that's been shaped by power and profit and dispossession. We can't actually move forward and make informed decisions if we're refusing to acknowledge what's actually happened previously. Me's also asked how has the introduction of foreign organisms especially plant and fungi affected Australia's native ecology.

Sustainability is linked to the way indigenous Australians lived. They used biodegradable resources that would decompose in the environment. They also had to have sustainability linked into their family structures, into how they navigated society.

"I was making mistakes early on cuz I didn't know any better," she says. "I cannot emphasize enough how important it is to know your supervisors and know that they respect where you're coming from with the research that you're doing".
