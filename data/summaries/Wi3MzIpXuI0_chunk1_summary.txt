Putin Manitwa is studying robotics and meatronics engineering at Swimburn University of Technology. His design idea is to make a shoe that generates electricity while you walk. Every time we take a step, the spring-loaded hinge will be pressed in, transferring the highinetic energy to a wheel. The wheel will then transfer theenergy to a dynamo to be converted into electricity.
