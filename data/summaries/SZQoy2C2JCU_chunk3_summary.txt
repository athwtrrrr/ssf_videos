You need to get to a point where you are confident on the stage and I always tell the startup founders like you don't go up on a stage and say no like you have to say you just got off with your hook straight away. Make sure that you have something that stands out and differentiates you from yourself but is actually going to be allegible. And also when you have when you're pitching, have fun.
