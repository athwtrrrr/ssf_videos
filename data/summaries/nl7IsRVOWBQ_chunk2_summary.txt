I grew up on a farm. We weren't big farmers and we didn't have lots of money and neither one of my dad was he had to drop out of school in grade six so he could help his parents raise their kids. My parents with that kind of a background they still wanted to support me going to university. They had to sell everything they owned in the way of property which wasn't a lot. And we all moved away to university together and so that was the way it was. We got a really good background from many different kinds of researchers etc.
