The National Teaching Awards is one of the most prestigious teaching awards in the world. To apply for an award, teachers need to show that their work has had a positive impact on students' learning experience and their peers' lives. The National Teaching Award is open to all teachers in Australia and New Zealand. This is the first of a two-part series on teaching awards.
