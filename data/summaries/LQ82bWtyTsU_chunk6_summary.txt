So, I mentioned before about the having multiple tracks. So, we're just going to go back to the control tracks button, which is this one down right at the bottom in the left corner. And you'll see that we've already actually got a second track already. We have the title that we put on before has automatically been put onto a track above. What that's doing is making a different layer above our video. We can change the size, change the scale of all of those in the transform tab.
