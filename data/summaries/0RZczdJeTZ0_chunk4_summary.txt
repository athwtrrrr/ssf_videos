Munda: "I feel like it's this two-way relationship with country and with the environment that people have and I'm going to talk about that in the next slide" "I think one of the best ways to sort of is to empower people. Like if your family is farmer mob, like they love farming and cultivating crops. Like there is so much power to using indigenous knowledge to help ensure that their practices are actually designed for the land" "We've got one planet. We've only got one approach. How do you approach the environment? We've got to use those skills"
