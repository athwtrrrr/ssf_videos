AAT is the international society for scholarship teaching and learnings. It was inspired by the wonderful pedagogical approaches that people have taken and we're quite comforting to hear that people across the globe in the teaching space are actually encountering the same challenges. I believe that through a lot of dialogue and collaboration that we can overcome that together in the very near future.
