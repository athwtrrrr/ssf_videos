Start Talking is a great opportunity to practice your communication of a STEM topic of your choice in three specific formats. Students had time to practice, hear from two amazing students giving their pitch and then they were put into breakout rooms to practice and deliver their own pitches. Students who are passionate about science communication will be acknowledged not with a prize but also their story is going to be published.
