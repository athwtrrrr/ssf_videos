Awards for teaching excellence and programs that enhance learning are a good place to start. The application process for these awards can take up to three years to complete. It's not just a once-off thing, it's you've tried something, you've improved it, made changes, and run it again. You need to put a lot of thought into your application. You have to talk about your approaches to teaching, how you've developed curricula and how that enhance student learning.
