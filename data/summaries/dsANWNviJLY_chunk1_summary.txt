Adobe coaches Zind and Carolyn will be covering a Figma workshop. Figma is an application which allows people to create digital interactive prototypes. We will show you how to log into Figma, how to apply for educational license and how to build a prototype. And after that we'll move on to the main agenda for today which is Figma.
