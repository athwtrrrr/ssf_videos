Janet: I think what was interesting about workshop 2 last week is it's around storytelling. And I think that's actually really exciting because if you drop into workshops that maybe were not originally designed for you, you get to pick up all these really lovely exciting skills. So yeah it's really applicable and it's pretty easy to transfer too I think.
