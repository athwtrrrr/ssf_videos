The app aims to help young girls connect with like-minded peers, particularly mentors and role model figures. Users can find mentors that they can connect with, known as big sisters, and they can browse and get involved in interest groups known as villages. Each day the app selects a sister of the day who's promoted based on a few performance metrics.
