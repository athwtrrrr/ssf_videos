Once you have logged in to Adobe Express, you should be greeted with a page that looks like this. And not only do they have video formats, they have photo, document, social media, and web page format. To upload a video or add video, there's two ways to do that. You can either upload a. video that you have on your computer already or you can insert a video that Adobe. has already made for you with Adobe Stock.
