Design for Change is an Adobe creative campus which means that we have access to Adobe's Adobe software. We have six digital coaches at the moment who are here to help you with your Adobe needs. Just before we start, we just want to make sure that you're signed into the Adobe Creative Cloud and have Adobe Rush installed and have the assets downloaded. All we need is a 4minut video of your STEM prototype.
