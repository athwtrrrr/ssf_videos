Scientists Sadler and Wallace have proposed a new method of upycling plastic by converting it into vanilla. Vanilla is the molecule in vanilla which gives it its distinct flavor and smell. 18,000 tons of it is produced yearly, of which 85% is synthetic vanilla. To conduct the experiment, an enzyme known as leaf branch compost was used.
