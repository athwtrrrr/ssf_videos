Adobe Illustrator is super handy for doing logos and things like that. You could still design a lot of stuff with Illustrator just as a graphic platform as well. Illustrator can be used in all sorts of colors clear through to black, white, red, green. And with cardboard, if you did want to do it, you could set it up so that you had a print out mounted on some card and then laser cut on top.
