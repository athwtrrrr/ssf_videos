like that. So great job guys. >> Thank you. >> You're on mute better. >> Thank you so much the judges. That is the very useful and important comments. So I guess this is the pitch for the investors. So if you don't sell the idea to the investors then they might struggle you know providing the funding to you. So but good job, great job, great topic and thank you so much. So I guess we are going to ask Sharil to invite the second finalist and then one member of that. >> there we go. So the clocks folks I think are the next ones. Clocks A. We see >> trucking and >> logistics. >> Safer trucking logistic in Australia. >> Easy. >> Yeah. Oh, hi. >> You said you want to go? >> Yeah. Yeah, I'll go. That's fine. , so my name is Tristan Sly. , I am the I'm a thirdyear computer science student doing computer Yeah, doing computer science. , and I'm here with one of my colleagues, , James Vervos. >> How you doing, guys? >> Yeah. , and do you want me to share my screen? I can share the video. >> Yes, that's fine. >> We just want you at this stage to share your video. Then we ask you, >> right? There you go. , can you see me? Yeah, that's fine. , so I'll just share my screen. >> , can you guys see that? It's a black screen at the moment. >> There you go. Is that all good? >> Perfect. >> Perfect. >> Oh, it's got an audio. We don't have an audio. >> Audio. Whoops. Sorry, >> Sam. I know that you have a solution for that. Could you please advise? >> Yeah. So, when you go to share your screen, there's a little tick box that says also share audio. And just make sure you've got that ticked as well. >> Ah, there you go. Thank you. Yes. Sorry about that. Pretty new to Zoom, so >> How about this? Hi there. We're the team working on the trucking logistics project for Clocks A. Have you seen this on the news lately? Well, how about this? Well, our client Clocks Aims to prevent accidents like these from happening on our roads. There is nearly $200 billion worth of major infrastructure projects to be built over the next decade on the east coast of Australia, mostly in major cities. All of these projects rely upon trucking logistics to successfully deliver to site. A key risk for these projects is the safe movement of trucks through urban centers when taking into account other road users. Currently, supply chain logistics is very much paperbased where it's hard to keep track of important documents for every construction project such as driver's licenses, vehicle inspections, and more. The core problem being that many drivers simply use apps such as Google Maps as a way to navigate to their destinations. The problem here is what happens if the app takes them to a bridge or a road, which is not suitable for a truck. Our project aims to solve this problem, allowing route planners to enter in a custom route that drivers can navigate to on their mobile devices, whilst tracking and ensuring drivers do not deviate from the supplied routes unless there is a good reason to do so. In the first few weeks of development, we worked with Clocks A to establish what their vision was for the application and created some designs which are being utilized for further development. The project consists of a full stack application with three different interfaces. Firstly, the fleet manager interface. This is a web application which allows the user to create custom routes and send them directly to the appropriate driver for navigation. The application will also allow the logistics manager to track their locations of trucks in their fleet via GPS, upload key documents such as licenses, and manage their sites, drivers, and routes all within the app. The driver app allows drivers to sign into a truck via a QR code and provides turnbyturn navigation directions to the site based on the custom route the logistics manager created in the web app. The application empowers drivers to report any issues or concerns they may have, whether that's in regards to the safety of the truck themselves or the route set by the logistics manager. Lastly, the site manager interface. This will handle trucks entering onto individual sites where they can scan a driver's QR code and either approve or eject a vehicle onto site. We utilized ReactJS for the front-end development of the web application. And for development of the mobile apps, we opted for React Native to allow for location tracking, custom routing, and turnbyturn navigation within our project. We also opted to use Mapbox map API and navigation SDK. The backend architecture will be built using AWS Amplify to manage backend logic securely within our applications. We're all excited to contribute to a project that has the potential to improve road safety for all users on Australian roads in partnership with the clock team. >> Yeah, there you go. So, >> perfect. All right. So now we are open to the Q&A and the judges >> stuff. I think I better let Elliot go first this time. So he gets a turn. >> , nice job. It was really nicely presented. , a few questions I had and this is probably going to be my ignorance again. , is there many systems that you can borrow off or use their infrastructure to tell you heights of bridges and stuff like that? I think I might have missed that somewhere in there. , but for instance, like the Monteu Street Bridge, is there a system that exists already to tell you things like that? >> , >> yeah. So, oh, did you want to go? >> No, no, you can go. I was going to ask if you wanted to do >> Yeah. Easy, easy. So, essentially, , bridges like Montigue Bridge and there's a few other main ones that are based in especially Melbourne or Victoria. Companies that actually work with supplying the logistics of trucks and where they're going actually present and have like a manual of locations like this and they can enter that into the application and we can use like a collision or object avoidance detection method to prevent them going through those routes or creating those routes. >> Cool. And would there be a possibility, I know Japan and Germany have it in certain places where they can speed limit cars based on GPS locations. , could there be a way to integrate that with controlling sort of the , ECU of a truck or something like that as well? >> Yeah, potentially there could be, but for this prototype, I wouldn't think so because that would mean using the hardware and the truck hardware as well might be a little bit out of scope for this. But there's potential to do that down the line for sure. >> Awesome. , yeah. No, it was it was very well thought out. , and I think would be amazing. I live in Kensington and there's a bridge in Kensington get crash gets crashed into almost every Fortnite. So, , yeah, >> it's a big problem. It cost a lot of money. >> Yeah, >> the one in Kensington doesn't have those things hanging from the bridge before though, which the Montigue Street Bridge still has. And I don't know how people still crash into it. It's crazy. It is really crazy. >> Yeah, guys. >> Thank you, Elliot and Shereel. >> I'll echo Elliot's points, but I guess yeah, I really saw your clear use case and your clear problem statement and also your product architecture and your interfaces into that. That was all really clearly and well thought out. So, I thought that was a really great job. And yeah well done. >> Thank you. Thank you. >> Thank you so much. The now we are going to the last finalist and again I invite Sharil to invite one member of one member of the leader team please on the in vessel composting system. Yep. Yeah. I'll share my screen now. >> Thank you, Nick. >> Can you guys see that? >> Yes. >> My name is Alex and I was one of the hardware developers. >> My name is Jackson Simmons and I was also one of the hardware developers on the project. >> I'm Chundan and I'm the developer for this project. Hi, I'm Ben CK and I'm a front-end developer. >> Hi, I'm Nick French. I'm a front-end developer and we're a part of Leader, an innovative way to make composting easy and accessible to households or businesses with little to no gardening experience. In Australia, nearly 7. 6 million
