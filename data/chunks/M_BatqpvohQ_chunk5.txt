Tom was clear but as again the Adobe coaches always explained unless you practice you are not going to learn and once you practice you might come across some of the problems and we are here to assist you I mean the Adobe coaches who are experts they are going to assist you. So again thank you so much Tom for covering the Adobe XD training. So again the design for change is an opportunity for you to go beyond your unit your assessment and you know come up with a 4m minute video of your prototype which is aligned with unpacking a real world challenge. So we are going to communicate the rec the this recording with you. We are going to invite you to join us in the next Adobe workshop which is Adobe Rush. We are going to learn how we can produce a video and of course to come up with the content and the script and showcase your prototype you need to come up with the startup presentation that is also going to be part of the training. So if you have any concern or question for Adobe Coaches or myself, please be in contact with us. Julia, do you want to add anything at the end? No, I think that's all from us. I'll edit this video shortly. And then we'll send that out and I'll send through our information sheet that's got all our links and everything on there as well. So if you aren't sure how to contact us, sit tight and we'll we'll get that information to you shortly. >> Thank you so much, Julia. I think if you think that there are more resources that it's useful for a student, please share with us with this recording and I will pass to the registered students.
