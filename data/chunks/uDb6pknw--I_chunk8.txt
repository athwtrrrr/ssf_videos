the existing infrastructure that have been built for the liquid fuels. So it can be applied without building a new whole system. Let's imagine in the future if you want to get hydrogen fuel for your car, you just need to make a call to order and then it will ship directly to your home. Really convenient. Finally, this technology is still have so many potential for the future development. For example, currently scientists are focusing on how to make the unpack and back hydrogen reaction more effective. On the other side, they are also finding the most suitable LOC compound because we have so many candidates such as this one, this one, this one or this one, this one, this one. The most suitable OSC candidate should be have low production cost, safety and especially has high storage capacity. So hopefully with the technology hydrogen can be replaced for the fossil fuel in the future. Thank you for watching. Thank you so much M for delivering the shipping the hydrogen to our houses. So I guess we are open to one quick question from the judges or if the video was clear we can move on to the judging room but let's see. So the judges are very busy with the scoring as you can see. >> Okay question if you like. >> Yes please. Just >> really great presentation. So where do we get the hydrogen from that we're going to put into this? >> do you mean that how can we produce hydrogen? >> Yeah. How do we produce green hydrogen? >> Yep. So actually we have so many way to produce hydrogen and for example we can produce from the renewable energy. We can produce from fossil fuel or especially we can produce from the water. So actually the hydrogen is mainly produced by the renewable energy and fossil fuel. But for the watch for from the water they are still on make a research to increase the efficient of this process. >> Thank you. >> Yeah sure. No worry. >> Thank you so much. I guess I am going to see how I can deal with this activity the task. Teslan could you please add the people's choice in the break in the chat and Declan can you please bring the your page share your screen with the cahoot so the audiences except the competitors welcome to join us so I am going to work with this Virginia, did you assign to go to the room? Did you receive the message? And Claire and Harriet. >> It went away before I could press the button. Like I just saw it and then I went to press on it and it went away. >> Oh. >> So I don't know how to get it back. >> Okay. All right. So I'm going to close that and I'm going to make it again. , I can see Rebecca and Harriet. They are in the room. And to be honest, I don't know how I should >> I don't know how to join it. >> I don't either, Virginia. I just I'll >> see anything that tells me I can join. >> Me neither. >> It just says I'm not joined. And you're not joined. Oh, hang on. , I didn't the IT people didn't teach me about this task. I need to we need to I didn't we need to find out. >> I'm so sorry that I don't know the answer to this. >> Okay, I'm going to see if I can create another breakout rooms. At least I can keep you two. And can you type in the online form, please? I'm going to figure out. And for the audience could you please add this game pin. So meanwhile we are working >> this meeting is being recorded. >> Join breakout room. >> Thank you. All right. So, can we ask the audience to add this pin code to the cahoot 150 824? So, so far we have two competitors. I guess we want to have the com we invite the audience to join us for this cohood question. The winner is going to receive 50 bucks. So, Declan, just wait for the audience to maybe be ready for this. And Castlan, did we add the link for the people's choice in the chat? >> Yes, it's in the chat. >> Thank you so much, Declan. I don't know if you are able to turn on your v video so I can see you and then we can see if everyone is ready. We just give another one minute. I see that the audience start joining. Declan, maybe we can have a bit of the audio. Meanwhile, we are waiting. >> What audio? The music. >> Yeah, let's stick to the music of the cahoot. I don't have other music. I can play from my mobile. All right. So I'm going to count down from 10 to 1 and then we are going to start the you know the cahoot question. So 10 >> I'm just going to quickly >> 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 and a half. 125 and I'm going to announce number one. Let's start. During the composting process, what do the microorganisms from the soil do? All right, next question. Let's escape. Next. How do we know that this continent has been managed with the fire? You have 20 seconds to answer. That is based on the video that we have seen from Claire. All right, let's move on to the next question. Next, what collagen does the tilapia fish skin contain? That was the idea for the wet helling. Hopefully you remember from the video. All right. Well done. Let's move to the next question. What bacteria was genetically modified to convert terafitic acid into the walle. So we are looking for the bacteria that was used during the process to convert >> actually in the photo there. Oh, then that's the that is the help to the I'm hoping that the audience like I see some of the competitors they actually participate. I'm going to make a decision at the end. Anyway, they have one question in this list. I see Gabby competing. All right. So, let's move on to the next question. If we have a competitors who are involved, we might need to decide All right, thank you Scopeboard. Let's move on to the next question. What percentage of the woman in the professional technical and scientific services fields earn an average less than men? Tell us about the average. If you remember what Hashittita presented during his her video. All right, let's move on to the next question. Please remember there is a link in the chat which you can vote for the people's choice. Thank you scoreboard. If you have your family member or your friends they can watch to your video. Please ask and share that link with them because very soon after the judges announcement Castelan is going to be invited to announce the people's choice winner. All right.

Sorry, it didn't like that. >> So, so you all are the competitors. Yes. So, I can see Gabby and Gabriella Hashita and is that clear the one of the competitors? >> Yeah. Yeah. >> Okay. Then that is the consistent setting and I think Claire is going to be considered as a winner of this cahoot. Competition. So I guess Claire, you won 50 bucks for answering the question. If we have the audience, that was the priority, the one that is not involved with the competition. But since three of the players, they are the competitors, that's okay.
