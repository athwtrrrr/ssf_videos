Agriculture, the vessel of life, has played a bivotive role throughout history. For generations, humanity relied on traditional breeding techniques like selective breeding and crossbreeding to improve plant and animal traits, shaping our food supply today. However, these methods were time consuming and often yielded suboptimal results. 1973 marked the turning point with the dawn of GMOs. A breakthrough by American genetist Stanley Cohen along with the American biotechnologist Herbert Ber. Genetic modification or GM is a revolutionary technology that involves inserting DNA into an organism's genome to create an enhanced versions of that particular organism. Yet the war against GMOs began. People had countless questions about this new incomprehensible concept. Would it affect our genes? Could it cause allergies or even cancer? GMOs raised concerns about potential plant hybridization, increased pesticides use, and environmental impacts. While most scientists agreed on their safety, health concerns, particularly allergenicity and long-term effects remain. Meanwhile, the world is suffering from climate change, natural disasters, pollution, and dwindling resources. Our earth is in peril, affecting agriculture. Less land is suitable for crops and food security plumped worldwide. Farmers are facing insurmountable obstacles and world hunger surged. With the global population projected to grow by 2 billion people by 2030, the problem is definitely intensifying. Millions of children are suffering from malnutrition and nearly half of child death were due to hunger related issues. The earth is ailing and so are we. However, there is always hope. In the late 1990s, a Russian scientist introduced golden rice, a true game changer. This unique rice variety contained beta carotin, a precursor to vitamin A, crucial for health. Genetic engineering enabled the transfer of this substance directly into rice grains preventing immune dysfunction and eyesight in bearing deficiencies. Golden rice was a humanitarian triumph a true eye opener. Golden rice is just one example of how genetic engineering can transform agriculture. GM crops exhibit traits such as enhanced heat and draw tolerance, superior nutritional profiles, heightened resistance to bests and enhanced photosynthetic efficiency, rendering them pivotal contributors to addressing global food security. While worries remain, it's crucial to base our decisions on the best available scientific evidence and acknowledge the gamechanging potential of genetic engineering to improve global food security and save lives. GM crops may be our beacon of hope for a hunger-free future. I am Bah Abd and this is harvesting hope through GM crops. Thank you.
