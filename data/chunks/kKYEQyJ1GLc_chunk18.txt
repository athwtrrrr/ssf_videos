and we support each other and I think that's why I really appreciate all the insights all the comments all the instruction we've provided. Hope this is the beginning of you thinking reaching out to the people and asking for your mentors and sharing the idea and then coming with a fabulous you know idea that it can help and improve our society of practice. Thank you so much and yes because nearly 30 years ago the government introduced fellowships. They don't run anymore but I knew nothing about fellowships and was me coming to an event like this where I thought I've got an idea and I went spoke to a senior academic about my idea and they said oh teaching fellowship with that idea but I thought and then I spoke to somebody else and they said hey that idea is merit. So speak to different people because some people will not agree with you and some people will because this is a science mainly a science computing and >> this is in fact it's it's open to everyone. >> I did want to say that the Australian Council Deans of Science offer fellowships >> and they're learning and teaching fellowships and they are $100,000. They were they I think they still are but they're a good amount of money to do a really substantial study. So please look into that from the Australian Council of Deans of Science. So there's a lot of work being done there >> and I think the last statement from me that's why with Mercy members we are looking for any of these opportunities and we are coming with more of these connection events. So at least we can inform each other what are the opportunities we have then we can start being prepared plan and collect the evidence as we just hear today. So stay tuned. We are coming with more events and thank you so much for your time. I would like to invite you for the launch. Thank you and thank you to the people online.
