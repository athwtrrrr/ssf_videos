>> All right. Yeah, that's a great idea because a lot of these type of technologies are still is not really user friendly for some of the you know elders in our family members. All right. So is there any question for Maine? Again for those students who are going to watch this pitch presentation that was just a showcase of how the product that you're going to submit to us as part of design for change is decided to be a 4minut video and that 4minut video I just wanted to give you this option of presenting the way that you can hook as main mentioned Start with introducing your challenge and then start maybe the way that I wanted in the 4 minute video. I wanted a bit of time on maybe one minute on your design. I'm interested to see how that design and the rational and that thinking behind the design which is coming to be introduced as a design solution to the existed challenge. So but again you are welcome to use some of these active messages that mean mention. So but yeah we are flexible with how you are going to create your 4minut video but this could be the start of something that you would like to do in future and maybe you are coming with a great idea and you want to come up with your startup with a support of your peers or extended networking. So then that would be something that you will consider as mean mentioned basically for aim for 3 minutes for this type of a startup presentation. If we don't have any question then that means that this is going to be the end of this workshop. Again we really appreciate your time mean to be here and share your experience and talk about this active messages through this short effective inspiring page which can in fact hook the problem also the investors do you know mind to invest in our you know innovative ideas.
