ringit. The Malayan tiger only found in Peninsula Malaysia and southern Thailand is critically endangered and holds a deep cultural significance. Known as Harima and Papalang, which means uncle stripes, it was officially recognized as a distinct subspecies in 2004. In Malay folklore, tigers are symbols of strength and guardianship representing the wild lands that once dominated. Now, why is Malayan tiger considered as an endangered animal? Well, let me show you. This line graph illustrates the population trend of Malayan tigers in the 1950s to the present. According to this study, Malaysia was estimated to have as many as 3,000 tigers in the 1950s. However, the population size dropped significantly in 1982 and seems to be declining with only 200 Malayan tigers left today. Hence, this information alone serve as enough evidence for us to protect this endangered animal. >> Let's talk about the causes of endangerment. The first and perhaps most significant threat to the Malayan tigers is poaching. They are being hunted and poached for their body parts which are highly valuable in illegal wildlife markets. Another threat to the Malayan tigers is habitat loss which is caused by deforestation. Finally, the battle to save the Malayan tiger is hindered by a lack of awareness and inconsistent law enforcement. While laws exist to protect these tigers, they are often poorly enforced and without widespread awareness, many people don't understand the critical situation tigers face or how their actions contribute to it. Now that we've covered on the urgency of the situation, let's talk about who can make a real change. Our petition today is more than just to spread awareness. It is about pushing for a crucial initiative in establishing a sperm bank in Malaysia. >> But what exactly is a sperm bank? >> A sperm bank collects and freezes sperm for future use, ensuring species can reproduce even if their numbers decline. For endangered species like the Malayan tiger, it helps preserve genetic diversity and supports conservation efforts. Therefore, the government plays a crucial role in this fight, but your voice matters more. Come and sign our petition to help us build Malaysia's first sperm bank for the Malayan tigers. Thank you so much. , I would like to invite group number five to start sharing your video. Please make sure that it's with the full screen and the audio. I guess we're just inviting everyone to focus their inspiring ideas but yeah please stay tuned we are coming with the feedbacks at the end. Group number five as the world becomes increasingly digitalized digital literacy has become a key skill for individuals to thrive in the modern world. So what is digital literacy? Digital literacy is the ability to navigate and use digital platforms for communication, learning, and information in line with sustainable development goal for target 4. 4, which aims to significantly increase the number of youth and adults equipped with relevant skills for employment, decent jobs, and entrepreneurship by 2030. Our challenge focuses on developing digital literacy and technical skills for youth in Malaysia, specifically for those living in rural areas. This is our challenge because a UNICEF survey found that 64% of Malaysian respondents recognize the importance of digital literacy for their future. We are focusing on rural communities because research has shown that they often lack behind their urban counterparts in digital inclusion due to inadequate access to devices, unreliable internet infrastructure, and limited educational resources. The Ministry of Education acknowledges the pressing gap in digital skills between rural and urban students. According to the digital competency score 2023, the rural students score lower than their urban counterparts in digital literacy. To bridge this divide, the Ministry of Education is actively implementing solutions. The first solution is infrastructure improvements. Nearly 10,000 schools now have highspeed internet of around 30 to 300 Mbps. Fiber optic lines are installed in 4,957 schools, 4G wireless broadband in 4,681 schools and satellite connections in 599 schools. The second solution is technology resources. The Ministry of Education is supplying rural schools with essential technology, including laptops, charging carts, and projectors. Teachers receive 50,000 laptops and hybrid classrooms are being piloted in 110 schools. Schools have also gained free access to the dilemma learning platform with a G Suite enterprise for education license. Additionally, the Sarwak state has made progress through the Pandai program. It is a free course designed to ensure everyone has access to essential digital skills reaching various people such as those in rural communities, students, women, civil servants, and entrepreneurs. Through an online learning website, participants can receive many benefits such as improving digital literacy by teaching the use of mobile devices for tasks like communication, safe online browsing, e transactions, and many more. After completing each module, participants are entitled to receive a certificate of participation recognizing their achievements. In 2022, the Pandai program was honored with the UNESCO International Literacy Prize for its contributions to digital inclusivity, empowering thousands of SANS with important digital skills. Furthermore, as featured in the Teach for Malaysia 10th anniversary impact report, the Together for Malaysia initiative highlights major efforts to enhance digital literacy and technical skills among youth in rural areas. The establishment of digital hubs in rural communities offers access to educational resources and supports digital literacy initiatives. Based on these various projects and solutions, we aim to improve digital literacy by setting up crucial tech-based courses and digital hubs for rural communities across Malaysia. By improving digital literacy, we develop critical skills in the youth, enhancing their employability and quality of life. Thank you so much. I would like to invite group number 16 boss to share that video. Good day. I'm Sherifa and welcome to our presentation, Poultry Waste, a hidden opportunity. Did you know that chickens make up 95. 9% of Malaysia's livestock with over 300 million produced in 2020 alone? While this volume ensures a steady food supply, it also brings an overlooked challenge. What happens to the byproducts? Many valuable parts like skin, bones, and awful are discarded which harms the environment through increased landfill waste and carbon emissions while also resulting in missed economic opportunities. Instead of throwing these resources away, we believe they can be repurposed into sustainable high value products. Our goal today is to show how we can turn this hidden waste into something worthwhile. >> My name is Josiah and I'm excited to present our innovative proposal for converting poultry waste into valuable products. Our proposal addresses the pressing issue of poultry waste by introducing cuttingedge technologies and processes for repurposing chicken pie products. This approach not only reduces waste but it also generates new revenue streams and promotes sustainability. By implementing these techniques, meat processing companies can optimize their supply chain, reduce inefficiencies and improve their environmental stewardship. Hello, my name is Fatima and I will be telling you about the objectives of our project. Our first objective is to generate new revenue streams. This will provide companies new revenue opportunities by converting otherwise discarded materials into marketable supplements, thus improving overall profitability. Secondly, we aim to improve resource efficiency. Making better use of resources lowers energy consumption allowing companies to lower operational costs. And lastly, we hope to reduce waste and promote a circular economy. By minimizing the amount of byproducts sent to landfills, companies can reduce their carbon footprint and contribute to a circular economy model that benefits both the company and the environment. >> Hi, I'm Ezekiel. Now, I will talk about our solution. Our solution is simple. Turn waste into value. We propose transforming chicken skin and bones into high demand health products such as collagen and calcium supplements. But how do we change the poultry waste into collagen and calcium supplements? The process of making collagen and calcium supplement from chicken byproducts is straightforward. First, we collect and clean the chicken skin and bones. Then the skin is shimmerred to extract collagen while the bones are crushed. After shimmering, the liquid is filtered to obtain the collagion and the bones are heated to remove impurities. The collagen is then dried into powder and the bones are muled into calcium powder. Finally, both powders are packaged as supplement ready for use. And this is how our collagen and calcium supplement can be made. Our supplements offers a range of health benefit too. Collagen supports joint health, reduces pain, and improves skin elasticity, making it ideal for both active individuals and those looking to maintain youthful skin. Meanwhile, calcium strengthens bones, supports muscle functions, and promotes overall physical performance, contributing to long-term skeletal health. But now we need to think who is our partners and buyers. Our target audience includes meat processing companies and restaurant that can provide the byproducts. We also cater to healthconscious consumers who value sustainable products like collagens and calcium supplements. By addressing pottery waste, we can contribute to a more sustainable and efficient future. Thank you for watching. Let's work together for a greener future.
