a solution. It is suitable due to its low energy requirement as it mainly uses gravity and minimum maintenance is required. Meaning less operational costs effective for rainy countries due to its anti- turbility and microgressence features decentralized system and affordable all things that are suitable for rural communities. Thank you. If you can stop sharing just considering the time if you agree I think we could just share the feedback at the end. Nick and Celia is that okay? >> That's okay. >> Yes, I think that's a good idea. >> Beautiful. I would like to invite the microplastic crisis to join next. If you can share your video, please. Microplastics are flooding our oceans with up to 0. 37 million tons of plastic waste entering the seas each year. This threatens marine ecosystems, chokes wildlife, and disrupts the food chain. As the world's fifth largest contributor to marine plastic pollution, Malaysia's plastic waste endangers ocean biodiversity and poses serious risks to both wildlife and human health. Marine plastic pollution is a critical issue and one of its main drivers is urbanization and industrial activity. Modern city life thrives on convenience with plastic use being a significant part of that. Let's start with macroplastics. Most of it comes from food packaging, bottle caps, plastic bags, straws, stirers, and beverage containers. These plastics typically end up in one of three places, landfills, incinerators, or the ocean. Plastic pollution is damaging marine ecosystems and entering the food chain. But what if nature could help solve this crisis? Recent studies show that microgy can help biodegrade microplastics, offering a natural eco-friendly solution to restore our oceans. Microgy are photosynthetic microorganisms that are highly adaptable. They can thrive in various environmental conditions including polluted waters making them ideal candidates for large scale bio remediation efforts by using sunlight and carbon dioxide. They power their metabolic processes including the potential breakdown of plastics. Microguy provide a sustainable scalable and cost effective solution to plastic pollution easily grown in bioreactors or polluted waters with minimal energy. But how does it work? Let's break down the mechanism. Step one, attachment. Micro attached to microplastics forming a biofilm that supports microbial growth and begins the degradation process. Step two, enzyme secretion. The microbes secrete specific enzymes lipes and sterises which break down the plastic polymers. Step three, oxidative degradation. Reactive oxygen species are produced which degrade plastics susceptible to photo oxidation further accelerating the process. Step four, degraded products. The byproducts of these degradation are organic compounds and nutrients that are safely released into the environment contributing to ecosystem health. One promising solution for treating polluted water is the combination of microalgae and bacteria which form what we call bofilm. This natural system effectively targets organic pollutants, heavy metals and even small plastic fragments in the water. Now let's talk about its advantages. This microalgae bacterial bofilm can break down organic pollutants and degrade heavy metals from polluted water. What's more, it can further metabolize smaller plastic fragments. It's also energy efficient, powered by natural sunlight. So, it requires minimal energy input and no chemical additives. However, there are a few challenges. Some types of microplastics are resistance to microbiode and plastics with strong chemical bonds are harder to break down. Despite this, the biofilm remains a promising option. The success of this bofilm comes from the symbiotic relationship between the microalgae and bacteria. Together they work in harmony to clean up the water in a cost-effective and eco-friendly way. Embracing circular economy principles helps conserve natural resources and significantly reduces waste sent to landfills. To reduce plastic consumption, we should avoid single-use plastics, purchase reusable products and choose alternative packaging material. Furthermore, investing in recycling and recovery infrastructure ensures plastic waste is managed efficiently, helping preserve the planet for future generations. This innovation is crucial for achieving SDG-14, life below water. If our project succeeds, the social impacts could be transformative. We'll create cleaner, healthier oceans that protect marine biodiversity while drastically reducing microplastics in our food chain. But it goes beyond just the environment. By raising awareness and engaging communities, we're inspiring real change in how people view and tackle micro plastic pollution. In the long run, this could reshape policies on plastic use, spur innovation in eco-friendly solutions, and enhance public health by minimizing the risk associated with microplastic injection. A thriving ocean leads to a brighter future for us all. So much group number two. Do we have any comments Nick or we are going to keep it at the end? So meanwhile we are waiting. I >> think we'll just keep it to the end. >> Sure. Nick, I would like to invite group three stop ocean plastic pollution please to share your video. Good morning, good afternoon and good evening ladies and gentlemen. Today this video is going to talk about ocean plastic pollution. So the most important question of all would be what is sea pollution or ocean pollution or even ocean plastic pollution? Well, to answer your question, maybe by showing you these photos would give you a very brief idea of what it is. So where does plastic come from and how does it end up in the ocean? Now to answer these questions, let's look at the left side here. These are the most commonly found plastics in the ocean. Here we have straws, paper cups and plates, cigarette butts, singleuse plastic bags, food wrappers and even beverage bottles. Now these plastics are caused by littering where these trash would end up in the streams and drains through winds or even rains that would flow towards the ocean. So the next most frequent question asked would be how much plastic waste ends up in the ocean? As it turns out around 0. 5% of plastic waste ends up in the ocean. Well, you may think that this isn't much, but 353 million tons of plastic waste is mismanaged and among them 1. 7 million tons have been transported to the ocean. Not to mention 6 million tons of plastic waste that have been linked to the rivers and coast that may also be end up in the ocean as well. Well, let's look at this data right here. This data is about the world's top 10 ocean plastic contributors where they release plastic waste the most into the oceans. We can see that Philippines is on the top with 350 million tonses of plastic waste per year. India the second with 126,000 tons and Malaysia at the third with 73,000 tons. So, how are going to stop these comics from becoming reality? Such as animals dying, trash becoming mythical creatures, or even marine life crying for help because they have no place to stay. So, in order to solve this problem, we're introducing the Seab Bean Project. How does the Sebin project works? Now let's imagine this is the river. Inside the river, there is a rubbish bin just barely submerged inside it. This rubbish bin is here to collect rubbish that has been floating on the surface of the water. But as we mentioned before, there may be plastic food wraps or even plastic plates that have been contaminated with oil. In order to separate the oil from the water, we have installed water pipes below the trash can so that water can flow through the pipe using a pump. And inside our pump, there are filters to filter out the oil so that cleaner water would be released back into the water and the trash can be collected by us. So the seaman project has been started since July 2020 and we have already captured over 120 tons of marine return from Sydney harbor. Besides that we have also filtered more than 23. 6 billion liters of water from microplastics and liter as well as in 223 we collected over 4. 7 million plastic items including 2. 3 million tons of microplastic. Thank you for watching this video. >> Thank you so much. If you can stop sharing and I would like to invite group four the light of Malayan tiger to share your video. Make sure you tick the sounds and with the full screen please. Excuse me. I'll give you 50 ringgit if you know what is the Malaysian's national animal. >> H is it the Malayan tiger? >> Correct. Here's your 50 ringit. The Malayan tiger only found in Peninsula Malaysia and southern Thailand is critically endangered and holds a deep cultural significance. Known as Harima and Papalang, which means uncle stripes, it was officially recognized as a distinct subspecies in 2004. In Malay folklore, tigers are symbols of strength and guardianship representing the wild lands that once dominated. Now, why is Malayan tiger considered as an endangered animal? Well, let me show you. This line graph illustrates the population trend of Malayan tigers in the 1950s to the present. According to this study, Malaysia was estimated to have as many as
