Thank you so much for looking after the greener future. So now this is the end of the group entry. So I would like to invite the individual entry. Sanjita, are you in the room to share your video? >> yes, I'm here. >> Yes. Can you please just share your video? Make sure you tick the sound and come with the full screen, please. >> Okay, sure. We're done. Now, >> so that gives the judges a bit of time to reflect on six videos. Thank you. , can my screen be? >> , can you just play so I can see that the audio is also working? >> Good. >> Biotechnology student passionate about using nature's own mechanisms to solve some of our greatest environmental challenges. Today we are going to explore the science behind bioluminescent trees, an idea that would revolutionize urban lighting. Did you know street lighting actually consumes around 19% of global electricity, contributing heavily to energy cost and CO2 emissions? Now, what if we could reduce this by harnessing nature's ability to produce light? Bioluminescence is a natural phenomenon in which living organisms produce light. This occurs in species such as jellyfish, fireflies, and even certain algae. This process is driven by a biochemical reaction involving a molecule called luciferin and an enzyme called luciferase. When luciferin is oxidized by luciferase it releases photons resulting in a natural glow. Scientists are now working to incorporate this bioluminescent genes into plants allowing trees to emit light just as these organisms do. This could eliminate the need for conventional street lights. Recent advancements in genetic engineering have allowed researchers to insert bioluminescent genes from organisms like fireflies and bacteria into plant DNA. A study published in nature biotechnology demonstrated the successful creation of glowing tobacco plants using luciferies from fireflies. Researchers have now moved beyond initial experiments with small plants and are working on engineering larger trees that could serve as urban street lights. These trees could be designed to glow more intensely in the dark and dimmer when exposed to daylight, reducing energy consumption and light pollution. The environmental implications of bioluminescent trees are profound. According to a study published in Science Advances, urban areas using bioluminescent trees for lighting could reduce carbon emissions by 30%, making cities significantly more sustainable and also saving the earth. Furthermore, because these trees would be powered by their own metabolic processes, maintenance and energy costs would be drastically lower. It's not just about replacing lights. This is about creating living infrastructure that works in harmony with nature. Bioluminescent trees represent a new frontier in sustainable urban planning. By merging biotechnology with ecology, we could light up our cities while reducing our carbon footprint. Now, this isn't just a distant dream. It's a glimpse into a greener and brighter future. Now, thank you for watching. For more scientific information and studies on bioluminescence and urban sustainability, check out these references. Once again, I'm Sanjit Vinayagam and with the power of biotechnology, we can create greener cities where nature itself lights our way. Thank you. Bye. Thank you Sanjita. Now I would like to invite Hannady to share your video please and that would be the second last. Imagine a world where our most powerful medicines, antibiotics, antiviral drugs, and even chemotherapy agents are no longer effective. The threat of a drug resistance is looming large, and it's one of the most pressing health crisis of our time. As bacteria, viruses, and cancer cells evolve, they become resistant to treatments that were once lifesaving, leaving us with fewer options. But what if nature combined with cuttingedge nanotechnology could offer a solution? Now I want to introduce you to a remarkable innovation. Green silver nano particles. These tiny particles engineered through eco-friendly methods hold incredible promise in the field of drug delivery. Nanotechnology as some of you may know deals with materials on a molecular scale. At this size, materials like silver behave in unique ways. They can be more reactive, more effective, and more precise in their actions. But what's particularly exciting about green silver nano particles is how they are. Nie, >> sorry I just realized that there is a black screen. I >> can you please just go back to the video and bring from the points that we you stopped and then if you can remove that block and continue the rest please. >> Okay. Still there is a block but because we don't have time we have to go with your sound and the area we see. Can you please just bring it to the point that you left? >> Okay. >> Thank you. >> Now scientists are using natural substances plants. Fungi and even bacteria to synthesize these particles in sustainable way. So, what does this have to do with the drug resistance? Imagine trying to get through a locked door with a regular key when the lock has been changed. The drug cannot effective penetrate the pathogen or cancer cells. And over time, these microbes evolve mechanisms to evade the drug entirely. This is where green silver nano particles come in. These nano particles have antimicrobial properties on their own, but they can also serve as a delivery system. One that's far more efficient than current methods. By attaching drugs to these nano particles, we can target pathogens or cancer cells with pinpoint accuracy. Think of it like sending a smart muscle instead of a regular bomb. The nanop particles can penetrate cells more easily, releasing the drug exactly where it's needed and in the right dosage, reducing the chances of resistance developing. And because these particles are green synthesized, they are less toxic to the body and the environment compared to conventionally produced particles. This means we can potentially treat infections and diseases with fewer side effects. A major challenge in current drug therapies. Thank you, Hannady. I mean, you test it. It works, but yeah, there was a block, but we could see your message and hopefully your the judges can see your message about the nano silver particles for antibacterial activity. And now I would like to invite the last competitors Hades to share your video please. >> Thanks Peter. >> No worries. Addis, we don't have your video. We have a image of a river. So, can you please >> Sorry, yeah, I'm going to try this again. Give me one second. >> Thank you. No worries. So meanwhile, Hadis is trying to find a way to show the video. I would like to say thank you so much to everyone. You did very well like spending this amount of time creating this video and sharing your message. Is inspiring and we know that it's a busy time for everyone and being engaged in this competition is beyond your you know what is listed in your in your to-do list. So that is amazing. Thank you so much. So, had any luck? >> A bit. I'm still trying. I'm not sure what's happening. Give me one minute. Sorry about that. >> No worries. I can give you 30 seconds. >> Yeah, we did try this. >> You did try. So, if you can stop sharing because I can see your screen. Maybe that helps you to find it. Meanwhile, we are waiting for Haris. I just want to invite our judges to look at the evaluation form, the online evaluation form. Nick and Celia, you're here. So in about four minutes you're going to be invited in the breakout rooms and at the same time we invite the Nick and Celia to make a decision and the other judges point are also in evaluation if you struggle to choose the you know the winner. Okay. Now, Hades, please play. What if early childhood education could ignite a lifelong love for science in every child, starting with the natural world they already explore? What if we find a way to spark their scientific curiosity using what they already love, like Legos, dinosaurs, pirates, and vehicles? Imagine teaching biology in a way that's fun, attractive, and memorable. Biological science is at the heart of understanding life itself. Yet, in Australia, it's often overshadowed by other subjects. Here's the reality. Australian students from foundation to year 8 have access to almost 50% less science content than students in high performing countries such as
