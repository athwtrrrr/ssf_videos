this is a fully experienced you know a really great opportunity to actually get to know industry who they are what sort of jobs they are in etc. Okay. And never be shy, like what Angel was saying, never be shy to actually share practices. Whether things have failed, whether things have been, you know, successful, they're all just as equally as important and valued. So share that with everybody else as much as you can. You know, it could be at a departmental teaching you know, seminar, it could be a school seminar, or it could be within communities of practice forums as well at the university. And of course if you have the opportunity you can also disseminate that at conferences too. But most importantly if you can actually show that your interventions can be implemented in a much more wider context such that you can expand your sphere of influence and impact by applying the pedagogical approach in other units. Course universities that is also quite well received as well because then you can say that you get you can you set up a model and that can be actually be shared and implemented on the wider practice and community which means that the good teaching practices can go on beyond your little own unit and so for me what I did first I did not got jump straight right through to the AAT I didn't have the courage to do that but I thought okay let me look based on the evaluation that I've got you know and dial I've I've had with different stakeholders. I thought okay let me have a look at what impact I've made in last two is that actually sustainable or not. So I applied for a school teaching license award 2023 and was a great exercise because then the template was actually very similar to the vice chancellors as well as with the a and this was deliberate so that we don't have to reinvent too much of our narrative to some extent but I did actually in the end that's always the case right but at least we have something to work from to begin with so I managed to show at least two years an impact I actually built a timeline of what I did each year to hopefully improve the streaming experience. So this the panel actually have a very good perspective of you know okay you're always obviously engaging with reflective practice you're not just saying this works and that's it end of story you're always thinking ways of innovative curriculum to make it engaging to make it relevant for the students and authentic right and so it's also a good time to actually get feedback from the school level so even I know of people who have not been successful in different years they still receive very good feedback you know what needs to be done next and even for successful applicants like myself I received you know feedback from the school stating that you know you should start thinking about publishing this work you know and how to go about it. So it's all about getting feedback and then from then on I went to apply for the vice chances teaching on excellence more in the same year and that is where I started to really start thinking about how does my pedagogical approach and the contributions to teaching learning can actually be disseminated beyond swing. And so I sort of revoked my narrative to have that sort of choice and at the same time from the time principles share this award to this VC teaching excellence award I still actually had time to re refine my interventions further evaluate about what else can actually add value and also to I also had more time then to show that longer term and the wider sphere of influence and impact and then I was then approached to actually consider you know applying for AUT citation award and so I had a discussion with my line manager my ADA and also my mentor struct my next slide and then I started to then said you know what you should actually want to contact DRX which ends is in it as well and then you know and was very encouraging and I knew that there was going to be I think only six applicants allowed to be submitted but I thought I was just going to give it a go and so you know an and his team was very supportive throughout the process of my a drafty and without them you know I would have been a bit lost to be honest because the narrative did change once again although the subheadings were pretty much very similar >> but there's a lot of emphasis I realized and aut really emphasizing on drawing or scholar scholarly literature a lot a lot more emphasis than the other two which I was experiencing so that was actually very tricky for me because I think oh but I already talked about in my philosophy and I references in my first part of the application in the last part they're asking me again to connect to reconnect that so I found that part the trickiest but I've kind of somehow managed to actually then started to expand the upon a little bit more about what I've what I what I cited and went into a bit more detail and actually really specifically linking those details to respective intervention that I've done. So that's how I actually managed to I think got the message across. And so basically I thought I'll leave you with you know some of some little tips on applying for awards. And so I want I want to say okay the site's very blank. We get co-pilot to drop me a summary image right of applying for awards and voila there you go and it's obviously very generic. It's not wrong but it's pretty much it's pretty much expected right it's not really fantastic. So I'm going to enhance that AI output by giving you some of the insights and strategies that I have experienced and used myself and some of them Angela already has very kindly has talked about. Now first of all it's good to follow these guidelines. Obviously this is obviously duh right but you need to know what other teaching awards are actually available and I actually didn't really quite know to be honest with you when I first started my journey. So you know talk to your AD talk to ERX they're brilliant if you know there are any champion teaching talk to them any awarders talk to them but also you know those university emails that get sent around to us about announcing who has won this and who have won that don't just pick it away read it because then from there you know who are the people who are passionate about this space. You can actually contact your fellow colleagues through these announcements of who these winners are and get some you know have a conversation going but also it's very important to start thinking about not just being involved in your own discipline research but also to think about L&T as a research domain as well and so start engaging with scholarship learning and teaching and this will allow you to keep a breast of the current research questions in L&T the challenges and the strategies to innovate curriculum okay and also with this sometimes you might also start thinking about how can you craft your the evidence of impact into a paper as well and that will then broaden your outreach if you like wherever you can you know do disseminate share sharing is caring and so share you know your approaches what went wrong what did not do so well what really went really brilliantly at different kinds of you know sort of forums and this is a really good opportunity to really network with like-minded people and sometimes you might think also about networking people with minded could also build collaborations and research in the L&T space right but at the same time you know seek feedback you know because you when you get questions asked right during these talks it also triggers you to think about oh maybe I wasn't clear in this or maybe I didn't consider that approach maybe I should integrate that into my curriculum right see but also a really good place to start sourcing mentors who can potentially become your referees eventually but also the opportunity to meet other people who you might be very passionate about mentoring others as well and Angel you're all very happy to also talk to mentor you keep us in mind. But also very importantly like I said once again the sphere of influence and impact is actually very important. If you can demonstrate
